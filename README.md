# Practical Introduction to Data Science

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that serves as a practical introduction to key aspects of data science, including data cleaning, analysis, modeling, and review, with a specific focus on understanding incidents involving migrants. The notebook is structured into several sections, each dedicated to a different aspect of data science.

## Overview

The notebook is divided into the following sections:

1. **Data Cleaning:** Techniques and methods for preparing raw data for analysis, including handling categorical and numerical features, understanding data types, and dealing with missing or incomplete information.
2. **Data Analysis:** Exploring and analyzing the cleaned data to uncover patterns, trends, and relationships.
3. **Data Modeling:** Building models based on the analyzed data to make predictions or understand phenomena.
4. **Review:** Assessing the performance of the data models and analyzing their results.

## Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

In this section, we explore the following concepts:
1. Distinction between categorical and numerical features.
2. Examination of available data types within the dataset.
3. Identification and handling of missing, blank, or empty values.

## Analysis Capabilities

Using the principles and methods outlined in this notebook, users can perform a range of analyses related to incidents involving migrants, such as:

- Identifying the year with the highest and lowest number of incidents.
- Determining which month experienced the highest and lowest total number of dead and missing migrants.
- Finding out in which region incidents have the highest total number of dead and missing migrants.
- Analyzing how the total number of fatalities has evolved over the years.
- Recording the number of survivors as per the data available for different years.
- Comparing the total number of dead and missing migrants with the minimum estimated count of missing migrants in the dataset.

This project aims to provide foundational understanding and practical skills in data science, with a focus on real-world applications and analyses.

## How to Use This Notebook

1. Clone this repository to your local machine or open it in a Jupyter environment.
2. Follow the instructions and examples provided in each section of the notebook.
3. Modify and run the cells to apply the concepts to your own data and analyses.

Feel free to explore the data and apply the techniques discussed to gain insights and build your own data models.
